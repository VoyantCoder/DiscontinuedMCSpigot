# There is only one type of Fire Cracker as of now, you
# could perhaps reach out to me with suggestions for things
# that I should implement. KvinneKraft@protonmail.com <---
#
# Standard modifiable properties:
standard-firecracker:
    # The radius of the explosion:
    explosion-radius: 1
    # Should there even be effects:
    explosion-fireworks: true
    # The amount of seconds after throwing 
    # that the detonation will occur:
    explosion-timer: 3
    # The amount of seconds that a player
    # must wait before throwing another one:
    firecracker-cooldown: 10
# Some more important and admin based
# properties which you may modify to 
# your liking:
