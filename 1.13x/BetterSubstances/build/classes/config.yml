# What follows is the table of substances that you
# may modify in any way you would like.
#
# A manual will probably be available on the spigot
# post.
#
# The custom items should have the same syntax and
# same order, such as shown bellow, you can not put 
# effect after cooldown, you have to do it as shown.
